                    <p className="mb-2 text-gray-300 ">

                        In the Smart BC Concept ecosystem, the platform is managed collectively by all participants. It's designed as a decentralized system, meaning there isn't a single central authority. Instead, decisions about how the platform operates are typically made based on the principles and rules set out in the system. This approach ensures that everyone within the community has an equal role in managing and shaping the platform's direction and activities.

                    <p className="mb-2 text-gray-300 ">
                        Smart BC Concept does not hold any funds, so the balance of the smart contract is equal to zero. You can check this yourself by following the link.

                    <p className="mb-2 text-gray-300 ">
                        Like any financial system, there are some risks associated with Smart BC Concept.

                    <p className="mb-2 text-gray-300 ">

                        Decentralization means spreading control and decision-making away from one central authority. In blockchain, this creates networks where no single party has all the power, leading to greater transparency, security, and trust among participants.
